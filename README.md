# NVDA Stock Prediction
Using Python's keras library and NVDA closing prices beginning in 1999, this project creates both an ANN and a LSTM model to predict the closing price of the NVDA stock for a given day (current up to March 6, 2021).\
Results are reported in results.pdf, along with a further explanation of the models and their configurations.
